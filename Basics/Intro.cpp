/*
iostream -> input output stream (istream + ostream)
istream -> input stream (cin)
ostream -> output stream (cout)

cout -> console output stream -> used to print the output
> cout uses insertion operator (<<) to print the output

cin -> console input stream -> used to take input from the user
> cin uses extraction operator (>>) to take input from the user

endl -> end line -> prints a new line

Difference between void main() and int main():

> void main() is not a standard way to write the main function
> int main() is a standard way to write the main function

> void main() is not returning any value
> int main() is returning 0 if program is successfully executed

> void main() is not taking any parameter
> int main() is taking two parameters (int argc, char* argv[])


stream -> flow of data

in cpp we use stream because the data is not directly printed on the console or taken from the console (it is taken from the buffer).
> buffer is a temporary storage area in the memory
> stream is used to transfer the data from the buffer to the console and vice versa

Advantages of using stream:
> we can use the same code to take input from the file and print the output on the file
> we can use the same code to take input from the console and print the output on the console
