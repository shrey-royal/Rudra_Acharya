/*
Tasks:

1. Shape Class: Create a simple 'Shape' class with a destructor. The destructor should print a message indicating that the shape object is being destroyed. This class can serve as a base class for other shapes like 'Circle', 'Rectangle', etc.

2. Calculator Class: Design a basic 'Calculator' class with functionalities for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Implement a destructor to print a message when the calculator object is destroyed.

3. Point Class: Define a 'Point' class representing a point in 2D space. Implement a destructor to print a message when a 'Point' object is destroyed.

4. Triangle Class: Create a 'Triangle' class that inherits from the 'Shape' class. Implement a destructor for the 'Triangle' class that prints a message when a 'Triangle' object is destroyed.

5. Simple Inventory Management: Design an 'InventoryItem' class to represent items in an inventory. Implement a destructor to print a message when an 'InventoryItem' object is destroyed.
